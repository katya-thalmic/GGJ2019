- Protectors vs Destroyers
    - You have to protect your home
    - Resources are located outside your home
    - You have to go collect them
    - Waves of enemies come attack your place
    - Multiplayer?
    - Top down 4-directional interaction and crafting
    - Everybody can attack each other
    - Saboteurs? everybody is assigned an objective [protect, destroy]
            - Convince others that you're a protector to get inside the home and destroy it's heart
            - Maybe just get rid of enemies; just have protectors and destroyers
    - First player is a protector, spawns near the heart (can be trusted)
    - Other players spawn randomly (could be destroyers or protectors)
    - Weapons can be used to destroy walls and stuff (that's what destroyers damage)
    - MAYBE: Each player is assigned a character, characters have diff abilities
        - One character can make explosives
        - One character can mine quickly/chop trees quickly
    - The heart of the house can have high hp so the first destroyer can't just rekt it on their own
    - Destroyers have an offensive advantage
