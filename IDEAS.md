- Home renovation game
    - Multiplayer/AI? [HARD]
    - Everybody spawns onto a map; there is a forest and ores and stuff and people collect it

- Build a spaceship to get home

- Home in a chord progression (coming back to the root chord)
    - Maybe just for the soundtrack (the soundtrack comes home)
